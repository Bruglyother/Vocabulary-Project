# Vocabulary-Project
An ongoing build of a program to teach spelling.

While learning to code in python, I sought out some simple porject ideas to challenge my skills.  One of the first project suggestions I came accross was to create a game of hangman.  So I did.  But after creating it, I saw a possibility for how to use this in a classroom to teach spelling, and possibly even vocabulary.  This then became an ongoing project, where I would add things when I learned how, or had new ideas.  It has grown from the simple hangman game into so much more.

As of 7/1/22, the program has the capabilities to create and store word lists from user input.  These wordlists can be used to play hangman.  I had initially attempted to do this utilizing a text file, but it quickly became apparent that a database would be better, so I changed it over.
My intent is to add in a few more games, and possibly in the future add in a definitions capability, allowing the program to be expanded to vocabulary games as well.

7/3/22 - Developed a wordle type game and integrated it into the overall program.
